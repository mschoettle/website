# Blog Relaunched

For a while I was dredding to create new blog posts because it was too cumbersome for me with using _WordPress_.
This also included keeping WordPress up to date along with the plugins and any customizations to it.

A few years ago, I came across the amazing [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
It is a technical documentation theme for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with many great features.
Documentation is written in Markdown and can be version controlled in a repository.
This is basically "documentation as code".

I first introduced it at [work](../../../projects/index.md#opal) a few years ago for various documentation sites.
Together with _Material for MkDocs_ this has been fantastic.

Since _Material for MkDocs_ has a [blog plugin](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/) I've been wanting to switch to this for a while.
I knew that this will allow me to write blog posts more naturally (in a text editor) and treat everything as code.
I finally got around to it and migrated my old WordPress site.

It is live now :smile:.

In a follow-up post I will write about the process I took to migrate everything and how it is set up.
