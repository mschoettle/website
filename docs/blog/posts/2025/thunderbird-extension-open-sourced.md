# Open Sourced Toggle Headers extension

A long time ago I released the [Toggle Headers extension](../2012/thunderbird-extension-toggle-headers.md) for Thunderbird.
I've kept it in a private git repository all this time.
This was way before I really got into open source.

Recently, a member of the Thunderbirds Add-ons reviewer team sent in a fix and asked if I was willing to open source it to make contributions easier.

So I did, added a PR to fix compatibility with newer Thunderbird versions and attributed this change to the reviewer.
At the same time, it gave me a chance to build a GitHub actions workflow to build the add-on file.

Even though I don't use Thunderbird currently anymore, I find it important to keep maintaining the add-on.
There are still a few users making use of it every day :smile:
