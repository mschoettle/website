# Hallo, Hi, Bonjour :wave:

I am Matthias, a German living in Montréal, Canada. I am passionate about tech, open source, racquet sports (especially table tennis and squash), and specialty coffee. I like to help others, and so just like with contributing to open source projects, I intend to share information here that are hopefully helpful to someone else.

I enjoy building and improving software, in particular building reusable software. With an eye for details and the ability to understand and see the big picture, I am able to provide well-thought-out solutions. It also allows me to quickly understand new/unfamiliar code or concepts and connect the dots when debugging and solving problems. I strive for reusable, clean and maintainable code. I see myself as a generalist, knowing various technologies and the ability to quickly learn new technologies and concepts.
